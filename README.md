# Hello,my name is Jose Manuel Mayo
### Programming student in web and mobile development

Technical study in programming for 3 years and currently I study computer systems engineering.

I studied the bivalent baccalaureate here in Mexico, in 2020 I worked a year for a micro-business in web development, the reflection of my dream of growing as a professional within the software development industry.

Since then I have dedicated myself apart from studying to specialize in web and mobile development, taking the knowledge acquired with the company where I work.
